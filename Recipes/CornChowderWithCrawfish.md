# Corn Chowder with Crawfish

serves 8-10

Frugal Gourmet recipe

## Ingredients

* 2 quarts Chicken Soup stock (broth, boullion, etc.)
* 1 medium yellow onion, peeled and diced
* 4 tablespoons butter or olive oil (I prefer butter)
* 4 tablespoons flour 
* 2 cups unpeeled diced potatoes in 1/4 inch pieces
* 1 bay leaf
* 2 cups cream
* 20 ounces of frozen corn 
* 1 pound crawfish tail meat.
* 4 tablespoons chopped parsley for garnish.
* Salt and pepper to taste.
* Optionally 3 hard boiled eggs, peeled and sliced.

## Swedish Amendments

You can add more crawfish if you want. The crawfish in brine from Abba is great.
And a bit more cream because some of the corn is supposed to be creamed corn that I can't find here in Stockholm.

## How

Place the chicken stock on the heat to start waming up.

In a pan saute the onion in the butter until clear. Stir in the flour to make a roux. 
Stir the roux into the chicken stock to thicken the chowder.

Add the potatoes and bay leaf and cook until the potatoes are tender.

Add the cream and the corn. bring to a simmer and season with salt and peppar.

Finally add the crawfish for just a minute before serving. Add the crawfish juice if you want it more "crawfishy".

Serve garnished with parsley and sliced egg if you want.

## Variants

You can use shrimp or clams instead. The frugal gourmet even had a variant with 2 cups diced chicken added.
I also saw one that added bacon bits.
