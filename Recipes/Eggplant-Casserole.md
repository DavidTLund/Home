# Eggplant Casserole

Once again from the Frugal Gourmet, Jeff Smith. I have reduced amounts for 4 people.
Takes about 60-90 minutes total.

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup peanut oil - I use raps or olive oil.
* 1 large yellow onion, peeled and chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, peeled  and chopped fine
* 2 Eggplants/Aubergine unpeeled and diced in 1/2 inch dice
* 3 ribs celery, chopped
* 1 Bell peppar, chopped
* 1/2 tsp thyme
* 1/2 cup parsley - could be coriander
* 3 tablespoons tomato paste
* 1/2 kilo ground pork or other ground meat.
* 1 tsp Tabasco
* 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce
* salt and peppar to taste
* 1 egg, beaten
* 1/4 cup bread crumbs

## Instructions

Heat a large pot (he had a Dutch oven), and add the oil .
Lightly brown the onions and the garlic.
Next add the eggplant, celery, bell pepper, thyme, parsley, and tomato paste.
Saut√© covered until the vegetables are tender, about 20 minutes. Remember to stir often so nothing burns.

In the meantime brown the meat.

When the vegetables are tender, stir int he meat, Tabasco, Worchestershire sauce, salt and peppar, and the egg.
Place in a baking dish and sprinkle the breadcrumbs on top. Sprinkle cheese if you want.
Bake in the oven for 35-40 minutes at 175 C or 350 F.

Sometimes I add in chili flakes or chili peppars.
