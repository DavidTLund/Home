# Eric Ceasar's African Stew

This recipe is my best shot at what Eric did and talked about on FB.

## Ingredients

*  3-4 chicken breasts
*  Big bag of fresh spinach
*  2 large yams
*  2 packages 400g tomatoes crushed or puree
*  2 red chili peppars
*  1-2 dl peanut butter
*  1 dl peanuts
*  2 chicken broth cubes
*  1 yellow onion
*  2 garlic cloves
*  1/2 - 1 tsp. Cummin
*  1/2 - 1 tsp. Ginger
*  1/2 - 1 tsp. Cardemum
*  1/2 - 1 tsp. Cinnamon
*  Salt, but remember peanut butter and peanuts are salty

## Directions

Hack up chicken breasts in bite size pieces. 
Hack chilis and  onion. Peel and chop up the yams. 
In butter or oil saute the chicken, onion, and chili.
Add the spinach and tomatoes. Once the spinach has reduced in size, add the peanut butter and let it melt.
Add the spices and press in the garlic.
Finally, add the yams, the chicken broth cubes and enough water to cover them.
Let it simmer for about a total of 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Add whole peanuts about 10 minutes before serving.

Serve over rice.
