# Oyster and Corn bread stuffing

Once again the Frugal Gourmet. He really helped this poor American abroad.
I do this every year for Thanksgiving. I have tried other recipes but this one is the most liked.
Since we aren't many people, I don't always do a full bird. This stuffing is perfect for doing on the side.

## Preparation

Make a batch of [corn bread](./CornBread.md) two days before. 
Crumble it onto oven pans and dry it out in the oven or put it on trays and let it dry out for a day or two.
Remember to cover it to keep the flies away.

## Ingredients

- 4 stalks celery or fänkål/fennel if you want.
- 1 yellow onion
- lots of butter - at least 125 g
- corn bread crumbs
- 1/4 cup parsley or coriander
- 1 tsp basil
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp paprika
- some grated nutmeg (musknöt)
- 2 tsps sage or salvia
- 1/2 pint oysters - Hard to find in Sweden so I use canned mussels.
- chopped up prunes.
- chicken broth - if you have neck and gizzards to make your own broth, cool. Otherwise boullion is ok.
- salt and peppar to taste.

## Instructions

1.  Remember to make the corn bread crumbs ahead of time.
2.  If you have the gizzards, make the broth any way you know how.
3.  Sauté the onion, celery. If you had the gizzards sauté in that pan afterwards for more flavor and any good meaty bits to add to the stuffing. 
4.  Mix everything in a big bowl.
5. Add broth and melted butter so it is as moist as you want. **NOTE:** This is more important when the stuffing is made on its own. If you are stuffing a bird it could be dryer.
