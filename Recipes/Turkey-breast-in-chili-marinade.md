# Turkey breast in Chili marinade

This is my go to prep of turkey breast or other parts for Thanksgiving.
It is perfect on trukey breast and dark meat wings/legs/roast.
Just remember the dark meat dries out faster in the oven.

## Ingredients

- 8-10 chili peppars - I usually mix red and green.
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- 1 tsp oregano
- salt

## Instructions

1.  Chop up the chilis and the garlic.
2.  Mix it all to gether.
3.  User a mixer to make it smoother and let it sit awhile. I usually do this the night before.
4.  Next day apply this to the turkey parts. And let it marinate a while.
5.  Do the turkey in the oven.

**Note:** I still baste the turkey a bit with butter so it stays moist and looks good.

**PS:** If you make gravy from the pan drippings, there will be a good kick to the gravy.
